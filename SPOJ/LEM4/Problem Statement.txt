When she was young, Sherry used to play a game called "White Black" with her father.

He had a long piece of paper with the size of 1 * n, which was separated into n small squares. Initially, every square was white.
Sherry's father then colored the square from position L to R with the same color (black or white). Sherry had to find the longest 
streak of consecutive white squares. Help her find the answer!

Input

1st line: N (1 <= N <= 10000)

2nd line: M (1 <= M <= 100000)

The next M lines may be in one of these three formats

1 L R (1 <= L <= R <= N): Color squares from L to R with the color white.

2 L R (1 <= L <= R <= N): Color squares from L to R with the color black.

3: Find the longest streak of consecutive white squares

Output
For each line of the third format, print a single line contain an integer - the answer to the query.
